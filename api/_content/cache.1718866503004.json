Maxthon Browser has won widespread acclaim from users worldwide for its unique user experience and innovative features such as cloud service synchronization, mouse gesture operations, Maxnote, UUMail, ad blocker, resource sniffer, and customizable skins.\nAs a professional browser developer in China, Maxthon has been committed to the research and innovation of browser software technology for a long time. Its core product line includes the Maxthon Browser series and supporting online service sites. Maxthon's mission is to integrate all online applications, connecting every person behind the network terminal, to create more convenient ways for people to communicate, share, and access services, thus promoting social progress by empowering individuals.\nThe predecessor of the Maxthon browser was MyIE2, created by founder Jeff Chen out of dissatisfaction with existing browsers on the market. Driven by his pursuit of an ideal browsing experience, he independently developed this product. Later, an Irish user gave MyIE2 a meaningful new name—Maxthon, which cleverly combines \"Max\" (symbolizing peak and excellence) and \"Thon\" (derived from marathon, implying endurance and longevity). The Chinese name \"傲游\" (Ào Yóu) complements the English name, conveying a brand spirit of standing out among peers and continuous progress.\nSince being renamed Maxthon, the browser has achieved significant success in the global market, with active users exceeding tens of millions and a deep user base across 120 countries and regions. Its diverse features are particularly noteworthy, with global users actively participating in product experience and spontaneously translating the browser into 55 language versions, fully demonstrating Maxthon's international influence and high user engagement and loyalty."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"advantages"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Advantages"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h4","props":{"id":"chromium-plugin-support"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Chromium Plugin Support"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In 2023, Maxthon Browser 7.0 achieved a major breakthrough in maintaining seamless compatibility with the Chrome ecosystem, fully supporting all plugins designed and developed for Google Chrome.

Its core product line includes the Maxthon Browser series and supporting online service sites. Maxthon's mission is to integrate all online applications, connecting every person behind the network terminal, to create more convenient ways for people to communicate, share, and access services, thus promoting social progress by empowering individuals.\nThe predecessor of the Maxthon browser was MyIE2, created by founder Jeff Chen out of dissatisfaction with existing browsers on the market. Driven by his pursuit of an ideal browsing experience, he independently developed this product. Later, an Irish user gave MyIE2 a meaningful new name—Maxthon, which cleverly combines \"Max\" (symbolizing peak and excellence) and \"Thon\" (derived from marathon, implying endurance and longevity). The Chinese name \"傲游\" (Ào Yóu) complements the English name, conveying a brand spirit of standing out among peers and continuous progress.\nSince being renamed Maxthon, the browser has achieved significant success in the global market, with active users exceeding tens of millions and a deep user base across 120 countries and regions. Its diverse features are particularly noteworthy, with global users actively participating in product experience and spontaneously translating the browser into 55 language versions, fully demonstrating Maxthon's international influence and high user engagement and loyalty."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"advantages"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Advantages"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h4","props":{"id":"chromium-plugin-support"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Chromium Plugin Support"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In 2023, Maxthon Browser 7.0 achieved a major breakthrough in maintaining seamless compatibility with the Chrome ecosystem, fully supporting all plugins designed and developed for Google Chrome.
